isodom.js is an isometric DOM-based grid/item system for games

# dependencies

isodom.js does not depend on anything, so you can sleep well at night, while others fear of breaking changes!

# adapters

Apart from the vanilla JavaScript API exposed by isodom.js, we are planning to add adapters/wrappers for Angular and jQuery, that will be contained in their own repective repositories in the future. Stay tuned!

What? You can't wait, and are willing to help us out? Feel free to message us and become a contributer!
